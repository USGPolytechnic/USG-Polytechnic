We structured each message using a byte-based format, including clearly defined headers, source IDs, destination IDs, message data, and footers, ensuring that all components correctly interpret and respond to data. The decision-making process involved analyzing how each team member\u2019s subsystem contributes to the overall communication flow. Ethan\u2019s sensor system collects temperature and humidity readings and transmits them via UART and WiFi, ensuring accurate environmental monitoring. Sanjit\u2019s web subsystem processes and forwards sensor readings to the MQTT server, storing and publishing updated data. Kevin\u2019s HMI subsystem receives and displays temperature, humidity, and water flow rate information, ensuring users have real-time system feedback. Siddhant\u2019s motor subsystem uses sensor data to adjust actuator states, controlling cooling mechanisms based on temperature levels. The sequence diagram demonstrates how each component interacts, with messages structured to maintain recurring updates (automatic temperature readings) and event-driven interactions (manual motor adjustments via Bluetooth and UART). Our format also incorporates system integrity mechanisms, ensuring valid message transmission without corruption. By structuring our communication logic around a fixed byte format, we allow for scalable, expandable control, ensuring seamless data processing across I2C, SPI, UART, and MQTT protocols. This approach guarantees that our system functions reliably, meeting user needs and project requirements, while allowing real-world implementation for sensor-actuator-controlled cooling systems.</p> <p>Our team invested significant effort into defining a robust, efficient, and extensible message format. Below is a step-by-step outline of how we arrived at our final design:</p> <ol> <li>Choosing a Fixed-Length Frame </li> <li>Problem: Variable-length messages add parsing overhead and dynamic memory requirements on an 8-bit PIC.  </li> <li>Decision: Use a 64-byte, fixed-length frame so each microcontroller can allocate a single static buffer.  </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Simplifies CRC or header/footer checks, avoids heap fragmentation, and guarantees predictable timing.</p> </li> <li> <p>Implementing Header &amp; Footer Markers </p> </li> <li>Problem: Byte-slip and line noise on the UART bus can desynchronize frame boundaries.  </li> <li>Decision: Reserve bytes 0\u20131 for a unique 2-byte header (<code>0x41 0x5A</code>) and bytes 62\u201363 for a matching footer (<code>0x59 0x42</code>).  </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Receivers scan for the header, read exactly 64 bytes, then confirm the footer\u2014minimizing framing errors.</p> </li> <li> <p>Defining Source &amp; Destination IDs </p> </li> <li>Problem: A daisy-chain bus requires a way to route messages hop-by-hop to the correct board.  </li> <li>Decision: Use byte 2 for Source ID and byte 3 for Destination ID, assigned as ASCII codes (<code>\u2018E\u2019=0x45</code>, <code>\u2018K\u2019=0x4B</code>, <code>\u2018S\u2019=0x53</code>, <code>\u2018T\u2019=0x54</code>).  </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Any board can inspect these bytes and either process the frame (if addressed) or forward it downstream.</p> </li> <li> <p>Compact, Scaled Integer Payloads </p> </li> <li>Problem: Floating-point values are slow to convert and inflate message size; we need multiple sensor readings in one frame.  </li> <li>Decision: Encode temperature, humidity, and flow rate as <code>uint16_t</code> scaled by 100 (e.g., 25.5 \u00b0C \u2192 2550).  </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Packs three readings into 6 bytes, reduces bus traffic, and keeps arithmetic simple on the PIC.</p> </li> <li> <p>Message Type Field &amp; Enumerations </p> </li> <li>Problem: We needed a way to distinguish between control commands, sensor data, display updates, cloud uploads, and error reports.  </li> <li>Decision: Reserve the first two bytes of the payload (bytes 4\u20135 of the frame) for a 16-bit Message Type code (<code>0x0001</code> through <code>0x0006</code>).  </li> <li> <p>Benefit: New message types can be added by extending the enumeration; receivers switch on this field to parse the remaining payload appropriately.</p> </li> <li> <p>Error-Handling Messages </p> </li> <li>Problem: Silent failures\u2014like a disconnected sensor or framing error\u2014are difficult to diagnose in a demo or exhibit.  </li> <li>Decision: Define Message Type 6 as an \u201cError Message,\u201d including one byte for Subsystem ID and up to 55 bytes of ASCII text describing the fault.  </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Boards can log or display human-readable error strings, and the HMI can both alert users locally and publish alerts remotely via MQTT.</p> </li> <li> <p>Balancing Polling vs. Event-Driven Control </p> </li> <li>Problem: Continuous polling can flood the bus; purely event-driven updates risk stale displays.  </li> <li>Decision: <ul> <li>Schedule periodic \u201cSensor Data Response\u201d (Type 3) at 1 Hz.  </li> <li>Allow \u201cSet Water Flow\u201d (Type 1) and \u201cError Message\u201d (Type 6) to be sent immediately on threshold triggers or fault detection.  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Benefit: Ensures live monitoring without bus congestion, while critical commands break through immediately when needed.</p> </li> <li> <p>Future Scalability Considerations </p> </li> <li>Problem: We anticipate adding more sensors or actuators in later iterations.  </li> <li>Decision: <ul> <li>Reserve unused Message Type codes (0x0007\u20130x00FF) for future features.  </li> <li>Keep the header/footer paradigm intact so no existing code needs to change when new types arrive.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Benefit: New subsystems can adopt the same framing and ID scheme, plug into the daisy-chain, and begin communicating with minimal firmware changes.</li> </ol> <p>Through strategic choices around frame length, header/footer synchronization, ID-based routing, and carefully enumerated message types, our team crafted a message structure that is:</p> <ul> <li>Deterministic: Predictable timing and bounded bus utilization  </li> <li>Robust: Built-in framing checks and explicit error reporting  </li> <li>Extensible: Easily accommodates additional message types and subsystems  </li> <li>Efficient: Low overhead, integer-only arithmetic, and compact payloads  </li> </ul> <p>This design underpins reliable communication across all four PCBs, meeting both our educational exhibit goals and real-world product requirements.  </p>"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/Message%20Structure/#team-member-roles","title":"Team Member Roles","text":"Team Member Role Character ID Siddhant Motor Subsystem S Ethan Sensor Subsystem E Kevin HMI Subsystem K Sanjit Web Subsystem T"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/Message%20Structure/#message-table-message-type-overview","title":"Message Table (Message Type Overview)","text":"Message Type Message ID Type: uint8_t Ethan Role: Sensor ID: E Siddhant Role: Motor ID: S Kevin Role: HMI ID: K Sanjit Role: WebID: T sensor value 0x40 Send: Turn motor on or off.

The previous sensors either failed due to voltage inconsistencies or were incompatible with the system\u2019s communication protocol. The team ultimately selected the AHT21, which offered stable data transmission and was easy to integrate using I2C communication. This change ensured accurate environmental readings, improving system functionality and satisfying project requirements. The UML sequence diagram illustrates how sensor data is properly transmitted via WiFi and UART, ensuring reliable communication with the MQTT system and motor subsystem.  </p> </li> <li> <p>HMI Rework for User Interaction and Proper Display    The initial HMI design lacked clarity in displaying temperature and humidity readings, creating difficulties for user interaction. The team reworked the HMI structure to properly visualize real-time environmental data, ensuring that users could access updates efficiently. The improvements included optimizing SPI communication and refining display logic, ensuring that sensor readings were correctly formatted. This refinement is reflected in the sequence diagram, where the HMI now processes and displays information received from the MQTT system and motor drive, ensuring proper user feedback.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Byte System Redesign for Data Transmission    The initial approach to byte-based communication caused misinterpretations between subsystems, leading to incorrect actuator responses and inconsistent data flow. The team redefined the 8-byte structure, ensuring each subsystem clearly understands its role and can process messages accurately. This involved assigning specific bytes to source ID, destination ID, message data, and control flags, ensuring seamless integration between the sensor, motor drive, MQTT system, and HMI display. The UML diagram highlights structured message transmission, demonstrating how systems now exchange properly formatted data without errors.  </p> </li> <li> <p>MPLAB Code Functionality and API Integration    Initially, there were significant challenges in implementing MPLAB code for the PIC microcontroller, particularly in defining the API structure for subsystem communication. The team overcame this issue by carefully debugging the MPLAB code and structuring the API so that identification of users and devices followed a logical format. This update allowed proper recognition of commands from different components, ensuring seamless message routing. The UML sequence diagram now correctly represents this improved interaction, showing how messages flow from the sensor subsystem to the motor drive and MQTT system without data loss or misinterpretation.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Synchronization of Sensor Data Across Subsystems    One of the biggest challenges was ensuring that sensor data was properly translated across all subsystems so that every component remained in sync. Early versions of the system had timing mismatches, causing incorrect actuator responses. The team resolved this by refining data transmission timing, adding delays where necessary, and ensuring that each subsystem processes temperature readings in real time. The UML diagram illustrates how information is processed correctly through structured communication delays, ensuring smooth synchronization across all components.  </p> </li> </ol> <p>These refinements ensure that the system meets user needs, project specifications, and class requirements, improving both functionality and real-world applicability. The UML sequence diagram validates these changes by accurately depicting sensor communication, actuator responses, data transmission, and user interaction throughout the system.</p>"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/Individual%20Block%20Diagrams/%28HMI%29%20LCD%20Block%20Diagram%20%28Kevin%29/","title":"(HMI) LCD Block Diagram (Kevin)","text":"<p>LCD Block Diagram </p>"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/Individual%20Block%20Diagrams/Internet%20Connection%20Block%20Diagram%20%28Sanjit%29/","title":"Internet Connection Block Diagram (Sanjit)","text":"<p>Internet Connection Subsystem</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/Individual%20Block%20Diagrams/Motor%20Diagram%20Block%20Diagram%20%28Siddhant%29/","title":"Motor Diagram Block Diagram (Siddhant)","text":"<p>Motor Driver Block Diagram</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"Block%20Diagram%2C%20Process%20Diagram%2C%20and%20Message%20Structure/Individual%20Block%20Diagrams/Temperature%20Sensor%20Block%20Diagram%20%28Ethan%29/","title":"Temperature Sensor Block Diagram (Ethan)","text":"<p>Temperature Sensor Block Diagram</p> <p></p>"},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#mathjax","title":"MathJax","text":""},{"location":"static/node_modules/mathjax/#beautiful-math-in-all-browsers","title":"Beautiful math in all browsers","text":"<p>MathJax is an open-source JavaScript display engine for LaTeX, MathML, and AsciiMath notation that works in all modern browsers.
